It’s an ambitious 2D Boss Rush featuring over 20 bosses based on the letters of the alphabet, all with very distinct behaviors and movement patterns, solely developed by myself in around 3 months. The game employs a rather complex movement system, that while pretty finicky and awkward in places, is filled with interesting exploits and room for strategy. It was also designed to give the player as much freedom within their movement, allowing for a wide variety of ways to tackle the game's bosses.</p><p>The game was designed as a throwback to an older era where games were brutally difficult as a means of extending their length. This era brought on a modernist approach, with games intentionally designed to be as frustratingly difficult as possible. I aimed to create a middle ground between the two with Letter Wars, by designing incredibly difficult bosses, resulting in an elongated playtime, while also aiming for a degree of fairness and learnability .The process of designing the movement to be freeing yet balanced, while making bosses that were highly varied and escalating in difficulty was a herculean endeavour, and one made more difficult with admittedly wildly inefficient programming.</p>",

All of that on top of coding the entire combat system, adjusting the atmosphere, doing some artwork and incorporating all of the audio.</p><p>This project proved to be a significant test of my ability in forward thinking, and the ability to quickly and efficiently envision and layout a fun and interesting gaming experience. This was designed to be a relatively simple game in terms of difficulty, as the main draw was the atmosphere and the novelty of a Rock Paper Scissor centric RPG.</p>",

It’s to the point that my teammate and I constantly make fun of this game, as it is quite weak in retrospect. However, it did still have some interesting ideas to it despite that.</p>",
        "postmortem": "<p>Return to Your Roots was created during my first-ever game jam, the Global Game Jam, and it marked not only my introduction to the format but also my first time developing a game entirely online. Built in just three days, it was never going to be an ideal production, and my teammate and I still look back on it with a mixture of amusement and affection. Despite its rough edges, the project had some genuinely interesting ideas that made it a memorable experience.</p><p>The jam’s theme that year was “roots,” and I was genuinely pleased with how we chose to interpret it. Rather than exploring roots in the literal or ancestral sense, we designed a game where the player regresses to their origins, becoming weaker as the game progresses. The player begins as a mighty tree capable of stopping time and firing powerful lasers, but with each boss defeated, they lose one of these abilities. Their form simultaneously devolves, from a fully-grown tree to a sapling and, finally, to a powerless seed. The game concludes with the player facing the same tutorial boss that once posed no challenge, now a formidable and wildly difficult final opponent, a reversal of power that underscored the game’s theme of decline and inevitability. The way we flipped the inevitability of time into a reversal of time was equally interesting, as it presented an unconventional approach to that theme and idea.While the execution was imperfect, I still find this concept to be an elegant game jam theme interpretation.</p><p>Visually, I also remain fond of the game’s juvenile pixel art style. In particular, the second and third bosses, a sentient hourglass and a wizard who shifted between a baby and old age, were conceptually strong and fit perfectly within the narrative of time and decay. The art direction, though simple, captured the surreal, allegorical tone we were aiming for.</p><p>That said, the game’s development process and final implementation were riddled with beginner mistakes. Because it was our first jam, we lacked even the most basic workflow infrastructure. Without version control in the form of Github, we had to pass the Unity project back and forth via Google Drive, which led to countless overwrites and inefficiencies. My inexperience with Unity coding also showed, as I wrote much of the gameplay logic as frame-dependent rather than time-dependent, resulting in inconsistent behavior across systems. On top of that, the game completely lacked audio or music, leaving it feeling unfinished and lifeless. The combat system suffered from similar oversights: the punch hitbox was positioned far from the character’s actual arms to make the game slightly more forgiving, however, as a result, players appeared to damage enemies by punching the air. It looked absurd and broke immersion entirely. This could have been consolidated by simply having the punch animation feature the player sprite extending their arms to cover that hitbox, or even particle effects to cover the deadspace. Weak UI and minimal tutorialization compounded the issue, leaving players unsure of how to interact with the game. That experience, however, became an invaluable lesson, as ever since, I’ve made it a priority to treat tutorialization as a core design element, even within the time restrained environments of a game jam production, ensuring that players can intuitively and engagingly understand the systems in front of them, no matter how short the development timeline is.</p><p>Looking back, Return to Your Roots is the kind of game that probably only works within a game jam context. Its central mechanic, becoming weaker as you progress, is conceptually fascinating but mechanically frustrating. Punishing players for advancing, and stripping away their abilities, runs counter to what makes games satisfying. Expanding this project into a larger scope would have required reworking its entire design philosophy. As it stands, the game serves better as an experiment in theme-driven design than as a blueprint for a longer experience. If I were to revisit it, I would focus solely on quality-of-life improvements and stronger game feel: adding sound, tightening feedback, and cleaning up animation and combat. For all its flaws, Return to Your Roots remains an important milestone: a rough, chaotic, but earnest start to my journey as a designer.</p>"

This was a fisrt term 2nd year university assignment and definitely the weakest work in this portfolio, but important to note nonetheless. For the longest time, it was the largest group I have ever worked on a game with. It was a very crucial learning experience, as we had to create a game with a singular cohesive vision between 5 people who did not know each other very well.</p> <p>All of this while being unable to meet in person due to the pandemic, and unable to call because of timezone differences. This meant that this collaborative project had to be done entirely through messaging. It was an invaluable experience, as I was the group leader, and this project taught me how to cordially take different people's differing visions and organize and combine them in a cohesive manner, which is a skill I have been able to foster for future group projects which were significantly stronger in output and cohesion.</p>",
        "postmortem": "<p>The concept behind Renaissance Accademia was genuinely compelling. The idea of exploring an abandoned mage academy and uncovering tomes that gradually grant new abilities provided a strong narrative and mechanical foundation for a platformer. While the final product didn’t fully deliver on that premise, the potential was clear, particularly in the last level. The final upgrade, which granted players a bird’s-eye view of the stage, hinted at a far more ambitious and intriguing design philosophy. It was a glimpse into what the game could have been under better circumstances, with more time, experience, and creative stability behind it. Despite its flaws, I still hold some fondness for certain aspects of the project, especially the main menu. Its aesthetic, UI layout, and accompanying audio design came together nicely, establishing a mood that the rest of the game struggled to reach.</p><p>On the other hand, the game’s visual and mechanical execution fell well short of its potential. Renaissance Accademia marked my first experience working with 2D art assets (sprites, backgrounds, and animation) within Unity, and the results reflected that inexperience. The game simply looked poor in motion, lacking cohesion between the visual elements. I also failed in my role as a team lead by not providing clear specifications or technical guidelines to the artists. This lack of direction created inconsistencies across the art and animation that were difficult to resolve later in development. Even more detrimental was the near-total absence of feedback during gameplay. Player deaths, for instance, weren’t handled through a proper scene reset; instead, the player’s position was simply teleported back to the start. Because movement inputs persisted through death, players would often respawn mid-motion, immediately losing additional lives without understanding why. This created confusion, frustration, and a general sense of disconnection from the game’s mechanics.</p><p>The project was also constrained by the parameters of its original assignment. We were required to build only three levels, with the first two adhering to pre-defined layouts supplied by the course. This restriction made it difficult to explore the game’s more creative or narrative-driven possibilities. Under different circumstances, Renaissance Accademia could have evolved into a richer, more atmospheric experience, one that emphasized exploration, environmental storytelling, and a sense of discovery as players pieced together the world’s history through the abilities they unlocked. With more polished audiovisual design, tighter feedback systems, and freedom to iterate on the core concept, the game could have been a genuinely engaging exploration-platformer rather than a poor prototype for a great concept.</p>"

        "postmortem": "<p>My goal with this project was to create an endless runner that pushed back against the genre’s typical reliance on relaxed, flow-state play. Instead of the usual rhythmic, meditative pacing, I wanted something mentally straining, a game that constantly demanded the player’s focus. To achieve that, I designed a system where players had to continuously analyze the shapes approaching them, assess their sizes, and respond with the correct inputs. In that sense, the core concept was a success: the game achieved its intended intensity, keeping players in a constant state of active decision-making rather than passive reaction.</p><p>However, the game’s feel fell short of what it needed to sustain that intensity. It was often unclear to players when they had taken damage, when their attacks landed successfully, or even how well they were performing overall. The lack of feedback, both visual and tactile, made each interaction feel flat and unresponsive. The death screen appeared too suddenly, breaking the rhythm rather than punctuating it. As a result, the experience lacked the satisfaction and clarity that make high-pressure gameplay enjoyable.</p><p>Looking back, there are a number of changes that would have significantly improved the experience. Visual feedback should have been a priority: particle effects and subtle screenshake could have reinforced successful hits, while a reflected projectile animation would have clearly communicated when players attacked with the wrong shape. Enemies needed visible health indicators, perhaps a simple number displayed in their core, to help players understand progress and manage pacing. Likewise, the castle that the player defends could have visually deteriorated as health was lost, adding a layer of contextual urgency. Input design also contributed to the frustration; firing bullets via individual button presses led to overstimulation and misinputs. A cycling mechanic for switching projectile shapes would have been far more intuitive. Enemy difficulty should have ramped up gradually, with tougher enemies introduced as the player’s score increased. Finally, an animation upon defeat and a proper audio layer would have gone a long way in giving the game a sense of impact and closure.</p><p>While the concept succeeded in subverting endless runner conventions, the execution lacked the tactile feedback necessary to make that subversion enjoyable. With stronger game feel, pacing, and clarity, the design could better deliver on its unique premise, transforming stress into satisfaction rather than confusion.</p>"
