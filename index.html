The only thing that can defeat them are custom made bullets designed to destroy enemies of their same shape. If you shoot an enemy with the wrong shape, the enemy will get stronger and you will lose a life.</p><p> Made for the University of the Art London’s BA Games Design course in my first year, this is the first game I ever made from scratch all on my own, and as a result, it’s certainly rough in several areas.</p>",
        "postmortem": "<p>What worked: My aim was to make an endless runner that antithesizes the genre’s tendency to promote more relaxed, flow-state oriented play, by making an endless runner that was consistently mentally strenuating. By having the player constantly analyze the shapes coming towards them, as well as their size, and responding with the appropriate inputs. I believe the game was successful in that regard.</p><p>What didn’t work: The game feel is exceptionally poor, it’s very difficult for the player to know when they’ve been hit, when they’ve made a successful hit, and how well they’re actually doing. Things like the death screen are too sudden, and there’s no satisfaction to any of the player’s actions and the game’s subsequent reactions.</p><p>Changes and Additions: As stated above, the game required a lot of enhancement. Simply focusing on changes rather than additions, the following should have been applied to make for an engaging play experience for players: there should be particle effects and a subtle screenshake when the player successfully damages an enemy, when a player hits an enemy with the wrong shape instead of inexplicably taking damage their projectile should visibly be shot back at them to contextualize the damage received, the player cannot tell how many lives an enemy has and how much health they have left which can be solved with a simple number in the middle of the enemy’s body, the castle the player is protecting should show visible damage the more the player loses health, the button inputs for shooting bullets is too overstimulating and makes it easy to fire an incorrect shot, this should be replaced with the player cycling through the different projectile shapes, the arrival of the 2 and 3 health enemies should be gradual as the player gains more points rather than immediate, a little animation could play when the player is defeated to make loss feel impactful, and of course the lack of audio is quite noticeable.</p>"
