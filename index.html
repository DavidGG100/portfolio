        <p>Hello, I'm David Gadelkarim. I design and build games. Below you’ll find a curated set of projects with short post-mortems and links to playable builds and videos, plus a very wide selection of writing and documentation (theses, GDDs, narrative pitches, etc) are available if you click on the "Writing" tab up top. Additionally, if you want to know about me personally, in terms of hobbies, prior non-game related experience, and favorite games, check out the "About Me" tab!</p>

It’s an ambitious 2D Boss Rush featuring over 20 bosses based on the letters of the alphabet, all with very distinct behaviors and movement patterns, solely developed by myself in around 3 months. The game employs a rather complex movement system, that while pretty finicky and awkward in places, is filled with interesting exploits and room for strategy. It was also designed to give the player as much freedom within their movement, allowing for a wide variety of ways to tackle the game's bosses.</p><p>The game was designed as a throwback to an older era where games were brutally difficult as a means of extending their length. This era brought on a modernist approach, with games intentionally designed to be as frustratingly difficult as possible. I aimed to create a middle ground between the two with Letter Wars, by designing incredibly difficult bosses, resulting in an elongated playtime, while also aiming for a degree of fairness and learnability .The process of designing the movement to be freeing yet balanced, while making bosses that were highly varied and escalating in difficulty was a herculean endeavour, and one made more difficult with admittedly wildly inefficient programming.</p>",

All of that on top of coding the entire combat system, adjusting the atmosphere, doing some artwork and incorporating all of the audio.</p><p>This project proved to be a significant test of my ability in forward thinking, and the ability to quickly and efficiently envision and layout a fun and interesting gaming experience. This was designed to be a relatively simple game in terms of difficulty, as the main draw was the atmosphere and the novelty of a Rock Paper Scissor centric RPG.</p>",

This remains the most stressful game I've ever had to make, as it was simply too ambitious for the meager 3 day time limit. Despite that, we were still able to construct the vision we initially had in mind, but in exchange made some sacrifices. Due to the time limit, we had to change the game from being challenging, to being a simple game and instead focusing on the comedic nature of it. This restriction allowed us to rethink our base vision and make something more enjoyable.",

It was a very crucial learning experience, as we had to create a game with a singular cohesive vision between 5 people who did not know each other very well.</p> <p>All of this while being unable to meet in person due to the pandemic, and unable to call because of timezone differences. This meant that this collaborative project had to be done entirely through messaging. It was an invaluable experience, as I was the group leader, and this project taught me how to cordially take different people's differing visions and organize and combine them in a cohesive manner, which is a skill I have been able to foster for future group projects which were significantly stronger in output and cohesion.</p>",

        "postmortem": "<p>What worked: My aim was to make an endless runner that antithesizes the genre’s tendency to promote more relaxed, flow-state oriented play, by making an endless runner that was consistently mentally strenuating. By having the player constantly analyze the shapes coming towards them, as well as their size, and responding with the appropriate inputs. I believe the game was successful in that regard.</p><p>What didn’t work: The game feel is exceptionally poor, it’s very difficult for the player to know when they’ve been hit, when they’ve made a successful hit, and how well they’re actually doing. Things like the death screen are too sudden, and there’s no satisfaction to any of the player’s actions and the game’s subsequent reactions.</p><p>Changes and Additions: As stated above, the game required a lot of enhancement. Simply focusing on changes rather than additions, the following should have been applied to make for an engaging play experience for players: there should be particle effects and a subtle screenshake when the player successfully damages an enemy, when a player hits an enemy with the wrong shape instead of inexplicably taking damage their projectile should visibly be shot back at them to contextualize the damage received, the player cannot tell how many lives an enemy has and how much health they have left which can be solved with a simple number in the middle of the enemy’s body, the castle the player is protecting should show visible damage the more the player loses health, the button inputs for shooting bullets is too overstimulating and makes it easy to fire an incorrect shot, this should be replaced with the player cycling through the different projectile shapes, the arrival of the 2 and 3 health enemies should be gradual as the player gains more points rather than immediate, a little animation could play when the player is defeated to make loss feel impactful, and of course the lack of audio is quite noticeable.</p>"
